# The Odin Project: Recipe Website

## Description
---
I am learning web development using The Odin Project (TOP). My first project is to build a recipe website.

## Demonstrated Skills
---
- HTML/CSS
- Independently researched accessibility to make informed decisions:
    - Semantic elements in HTML define the page regions and content hierarchy
    - Links are informative, clear, and navigable by keyboard
    - Content is clear and simple
